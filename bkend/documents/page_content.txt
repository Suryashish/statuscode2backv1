Did not meet expectations

Not good. I had to throw whole carton as egg had strong fertilizer smell.

Slightly disappointed

Almost 6 eggs got fungus in two days. This is not the first time. Very disappointed. you should not deliver the old stock for getting money into your pockets. This is the last and final order from flipkart on eggs. Please check on the quality and do consider the peoples health. Whole family will suffer. Understand.
