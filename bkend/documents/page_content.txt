Customers say

Customers find the TV to be a good value for money with nice picture and sound quality. The performance receives mixed feedback - while some say it performs well, others report it stops working within a month. Installation experiences are mixed, with some praising the easy-to-follow instructions while others complain about the installation person's behavior. Connectivity is also mixed, with superb WiFi performance but frequent network disconnections.

 Nice picture quality! Will recommend.
Reviewed in India on 14 October 2023
Style Name: 5A SeriesSize: 40 inchesVerified Purchase
LG, Samsung, and Sony were, for 6-7 years, the only brands to dominate the television market. 
In today’s era, what I feel is that brands of television that come under 20k–22k (I am talking about a 40- or 43-inch TV), brands like Xiaomi-Redmi-MI, TCL, Thomson, Oneplus, Haier, Iffalcon, etc., or any other Chinese or French-assembled brands in India have all the same panels.

The price we pay while choosing from one of these brands is for the brand name alone, or what’s the current position the brand is holding in the market. For example, Xiamoi and Oneplus hold good brand value, so their televisions' prices lie between 18 and 22k for a 40 or 43inch.

On the other hand, brands like TCL and Thomson are working hard on establishing their brand to get ahead of Xiaomi and Oneplus. That’s why their products’ price for the same 40-42 inch is between 15000 and 21,000. 
All I want to say is that if you want the best picture quality, Android/Google UI/UX experience, and speed in your TV, then I would definitely say to push your budget 4x upwards and obviously go for the oldest television dominators in the market (what we call the Sada Bahar product), i.e., Sony, LG, and Samsung. Which price will start at 27k and go up to 40k.

Or

If your purpose is to watch DTH, HD channels only, want good picture quality, and a smooth Android/Google UI/UX experience does not matter to you that much, then you can definitely go for any brand that is selling TVs under 22K.

You can buy any of the brands, either Xiamoi or Thomson TV, because they use the same panels, the back body build quality is the same, there might be minute things here and there, but all over the experience and the quality are the same. They are all assembled; just the brand name is changed, and you are paying 2-3k more for that brand name only. 
Now, you’ll say, "After-sale service also matters, and it differs brand to brand.” Yes, I absolutely agree with you on that. But tell me one thing: in almost all these brands, you are getting a 1 or 2 year warranty. Right? So, if you purchase online, you get all the facilities, the toll-free number, the brand’s customer care details, etc., and if any problem occurs, then with such an established system, these brands are selling appliances across the globe, so these brands, if some problem occurs, will definitely respond and will the service you want, whether it’s Thomson or Xiaomi.

So, in after-sale service too, these brands are all the same. With the brands Sony, Samsung, and LG, it is all about reliability, credibility, supreme quality, and overall experience. 

All in all, I am satisfied with my purchase; it is a good TV. But when it came, I was going through the details of the Thomson TV. The reviews were all good, and I felt that 19000 ka Xiaomi ki jaghe Thomson ka same 40-inch 15000 vala le leta. Because saab kuch from display to features same hi toh hai, sirf brand name ka farak hai. But anyways, jo kharidliya voh badhiya, aab kya sochna.

If you are planning to purchase a 40- to 43-inch TV below 20k–22k, then go with any of the brands, from TCL to Xiaomi to Oneplus to Thomson. Only if a brand name written on the TV’s bottom does not matter to you; just the TV matters!!!

Peace!!!

 Few issues but overall fine and worth of money.

Style Name: A series 2024Size: 32 inchesVerified Purchase
Nice display and awesome sound. Only issue is it takes time initially to start and every time you switch off the TV you have to switch it On with remote also. Nice user interface. Best and worthy at this price. Installation is provided with TV but they charge Rs 400/- for wall mounting bracket. Better to order online and do it by yourself.
Writing this review after 4 days of use. Hoping it will lasts long.

Style Name: A series 2024Size: 32 inchesVerified Purchase
I bought tv on 17 October 2024 and on 13 July 2025 (which is within the warranty period) there was some short circuit inside the TV, so I requested service from customer care, they sent a mechanic after 2 days and ,The mechanic put the switch in the port many times for testing(my motherboard was in not burned before) and caused a short circuit due to which the motherboard got burnt and then he said that the motherboard got burnt while my TV was working perfectly, only a short circuit was occurring last and even after his checking the TV was not turning on, if he had repaired it properly it would not have burnt, and he said now it will have to be replaced and I will have to pay Rs 4500 for it, so I told him that it is my warranty period, so why should I pay, I talked to the owner of the service center, he was saying that the motherboard is burnt, it will not be completely repaired, it will have to be replaced and started arguing, when I asked if there is a warranty, should I pay When asked reason it should be done(about motherboard)he said that I cannot tell you, if you want to do it then do it, otherwise leave it, this is physical damage and is not covered under warranty, it is not written anywhere in Xiaomi's policy that if the motherboard gets burnt by technacian fault or manufacturing defect we will have to pay, if it is under warranty, when I have warranty why should I pay, I did not buy the TV to Watch it for 8,9 months, i had paid Rs. 12000 for buying it and the service centre people are saying buy another TV, you will not have to do the service,and that is manufacturing defect then whats my fault in this , should I ask for replacement or service of the motherboard

 Good TV, worst installation experience
Reviewed in India on 26 July 2025
Style Name: A series 2024Size: 32 inchesVerified Purchase
The TV is good, sound and picture quality is also nice. But the installation which comes along with is the worst. First, they forced us ti buy their wall mount. As we had already purchased a wall mount ourselves from Amazon, they cancelled our installation. Even when we filed a complaint to the Amazon, Amazon executive also said they have registered our complaint and will send different persons to install it, but this time, no one contacted. We had to install it ourselves. Such a mess.
